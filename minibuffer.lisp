The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
  DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
  HISTORY is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.
Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
  if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.
If fourth arg READ is non-nil, then interpret the result as a Lisp object
  and return that object:
  in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'
Fifth arg HISTORY, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
  the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
  history list variable to use, or it can be a cons cell
  (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable
  to use, and HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer
  history commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that
  element of the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions
  are counted starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.
Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE is the default value.  If non-nil, it is available
  for history commands; but, unless READ is non-nil, `read-from-minibuffer'
  does NOT return DEFAULT-VALUE if the user enters empty input!  It returns
  the empty string.
Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
 the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.
Eight arg KEEP-ALL, if non-nil, says to put all inputs in the history list,
 even empty or duplicate inputs.
If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
 then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
 were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.

The remainder of this documentation string describes the
INITIAL-CONTENTS argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when
studying existing code, or when HISTORY is a cons.  If non-nil,
INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before
reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.
However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is \(STRING . POSITION), the initial
input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position
POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to
one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this
behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'
and some related functions, which use zero-indexing for POSITION."
