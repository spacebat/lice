Lisp Computing Environment (LiCE)
=================================

What is LiCE
------------

LiCE is a GNU Emacs clone written entirely in common lisp. 

I've tested it on CMUCL, SBCL, and Movitz. With a little work it could
probably run on more.

Installation
------------

I'd recommend just loading the source from the current directory for
now.

## CMUCL & SBCL

To run LiCE on CMUCL or SBCL you need asdf, cl-uffi, and
cl-ncurses. 

1. Boot your lisp in the lice-0.1 directory.

2. Load asdf, cl-uffi and cl-ncurses.

3. run (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :lice).

4. run (lice::lice)

## Movitz

Here's what I did:

1. make a symlink lice-0.1/ to the losp/ directory.

2. add somewhere in los0.lisp (require :lice-0.1/all.lisp)

3. load movitz and run (create-image)

4. from all.lisp copy the commented out progn at the end. uncomment it
   and run it at your repl. This will make lice load after los0, which
   is crutial.

5. run (dump-image)

Now load the movitz image in an emulator or copy it to a floppy.

Documentation
-------------

There basically isn't any at this point. Most functions have
docstrings taken from Emacs. Your best documentation at this point is
the source.

Current Status
--------------

LiCE has the following implemented:

* interactive commands

* window splits

* input history

* minibuffer input, history, tab completion

* text properties

* a basic lisp-interactive-mode

* find-file and save-buffer

* basic buffer editing including the mark, a kill ring, and navigation

* universal arguments (C-u)

The code is still fairly volatile and in some cases hacky.
